There are two ways of building and installing sopcast-player.

- If you have vlc python bindings already installed in your computer, do simply:

     make

to build, and (as root)

     make install PREFIX=/usr/local

to install sopcast-player. The default PREFIX is /usr.
sopcast-player can be installed inside a different destination directory (other than /) via

     make install PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=my_destination_dir

- If you do *not* have vlc python bindings installed in your computer, do:

     make all

to build both sopcast-player and vlc python bindings, and (as root)

     make install-all PREFIX=/usr/local

to install sopcast-player. The default PREFIX is "/usr".
sopcast-player can be installed inside a different destination directory (other than /) via

     make install-all PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=my_destination_dir


To uninstall sopcast-player, do:
     make uninstall

To clean the source tree, do:
     make clean
